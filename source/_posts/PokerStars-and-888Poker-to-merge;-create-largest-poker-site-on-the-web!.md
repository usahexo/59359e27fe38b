#  PokerStars and 888Poker to merge; create largest poker site on the web!

In a surprise turn of events, the two largest online poker websites, PokerStars and 888Poker, announced their plans to merge. The combined company will be the largest poker site on the web with over 120 million registered players.

The merger has been in the works for months, but was only finalized in the past week. The two companies have been working on a deal that would see PokerStars acquire 888Poker. As part of the deal, both companies will keep their current brands and continue to operate independently.

888Poker is the smaller of the two companies, but it is still one of the largest in the world. It is estimated that they had around 40 million registered players at the time of the announcement. PokerStars is much larger with over 80 million registered players.

The merger is great news for players as it means there will be even more games and tournaments to choose from. Both sites are expected to continue offering their current promotional programs and bonuses. Players will also be able to use their existing account login information on both sites.

The deal is still subject to regulatory approval in a number of different countries, but if approved it is expected to close by early 2018.

#  Toughest competition around with over 20,000 players online at any given moment

In any other game, a peak of 20,000 players might seem impressive. However, in the world of competitive gaming, this number barely registers. This is because the gaming world’s toughest competition is found in multiplayer games.

The games that attract the highest numbers of players are typically those with the best graphics and most addictive gameplay. These games can keep people playing for hours on end, but they also tend to be heavily reliant on luck and chance. As a result, they are rarely as skill-based as multiplayer games.

Multiplayer games are popular because they offer gamers the chance to test their skills against other real opponents. These games demand teamwork and strategic thinking if players want to come out on top. The best multiplayer games provide a level of challenge that keeps players coming back for more.

One of the most popular multiplayer games at the moment is PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG). In this game, players are dropped onto an island where they must scavenge for weapons and supplies before fighting to the death. The last player or team standing wins the match.

PUBG has become popular because it offers a high level of challenge and excitement. Players never know what is going to happen next, and must constantly be on guard against other players looking to kill them. The game also has a steep learning curve, which means that players must constantly improve their skills if they want to stay alive.

And with new sites popping up all the time, there's always something new and exciting to check out.

If this is your first time foray into the world of online casino gaming, don't worry – we're here to help. In this article, we'll take a look at everything you need to know in order to get started. We'll cover topics such as choosing the right site, making deposits and withdrawals, and of course how to win big!

So without further ado, let's get started!

# Choosing an Online Casino

When it comes to choosing an online casino, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. The first thing to consider is what types of games you want to play. Not all casinos offer the same games, so make sure you choose one that has the titles you're most interested in.

Another important consideration is safety and security. Always make sure that the site you're playing at is reputable and has been independently audited for fairness. The last thing you want is for your personal information or money to be compromised.

Finally, be sure to compare bonuses before making a decision. Many casinos offer sign-up bonuses as well as ongoing promotions, so be sure to take advantage of them!

# Making Deposits and Withdrawals

Once you've chosen a casino, the next step is deposit money into your account so that you can start playing. There are a variety of different ways to do this, including credit/debit cards, bank transfers, e-wallets like PayPal, and even cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Be aware that not all methods are available in all countries, so make sure you check before depositing funds. Also note that some methods may incur fees while others don't – be sure to investigate this before selecting your payment method.

Making withdrawals is just as easy as making deposits – simply select the method of your choice and follow the instructions provided. Most methods are processed fairly quickly, but please bear in mind that not all casinos offer 24/7 customer support – so if you have any questions or problems with a withdrawal request, help may not be available immediately.

#  Poker Debris - What's The Point?

It would be naïve and disingenuous to suggest that poker is without its problems. The game, while providing value to those who play it well, also has the potential to create addicts, losers, and social pariahs. But these are generalities. What about the specific issues that face poker in the modern world?

The first, and most pressing, issue is one of legitimacy. Online poker was effectively killed in the United States when the Department of Justice seized the domains of the leading operators in 2011. This had a chilling effect on the industry worldwide as many countries followed America's lead and cracked down on internet poker. While some forms of online poker are now legal in certain parts of the world, the industry has not recovered to its pre-2011 levels.

One reason for this is that online poker is still seen as a shady enterprise by many governments. Poker has long been associated with gambling, which is frowned upon in many societies. In order for online poker to truly take off again, it needs to shake this image and be recognised as a legitimate form of entertainment.

This will no doubt be difficult, especially in light of recent scandals such as Full Tilt Poker's failed attempt to scam its players out of millions of dollars. However, with new regulations in place and a better understanding of how to run a safe and fair online poker operation, there is hope that the stigma attached to the game will eventually dissipate.

A second issue facing poker is its declining popularity among younger players. This is largely due to the proliferation of casino games such as blackjack and roulette that are seen as more exciting and less intimidating than poker. In order for poker to thrive in future generations, it needs to find a way to appeal to this demographic.

This could involve making changes to the game itself (making it faster-paced or more action-oriented) or marketing it in a more appealing way (using celebrities or other forms of media). Whatever strategy is ultimately adopted, it's clear that something must be done soon if poker wants to remain relevant in a constantly changing world.
