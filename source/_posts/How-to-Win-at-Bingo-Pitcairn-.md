The following are some tips on how to play and win Bingo Pitcairn:

1) Start by looking at your cards and see if you can make any kind of hand. If you can't, then you're likely going to lose unless someone else also has nothing. 
2) If you have two pairs, go for a Full House. If you have three of a kind, go for a Three of a Kind. If you have one pair or two high cards (Ace through Ten), go for a Straight or Flush. 
3) Pay attention to what everyone else is doing. If they're betting big on something, it's probably because they have a good hand. Try not to get caught up in all the action and gamble away your chips when you don't need to.
