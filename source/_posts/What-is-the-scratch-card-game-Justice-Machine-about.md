#  What is the scratch card game Justice Machine about?

The scratch card game Justice Machine is all about using your brain to win. It’s a game of strategy in which you have to make the right choices in order to come out on top.

The idea behind the game is to collect as many points as possible by matching symbols on multiple cards. You can then exchange these points for rewards, such as coins or power-ups.

To play, you first need to select a machine. Each machine has its own set of rules, so it’s important to read these carefully before starting the game.

Once you’ve chosen your machine, you need to select two cards. These will be your starting cards. You can then begin playing by matching symbols on both cards.

If you match three or more symbols, you will earn points and be able to progress to the next level. If you match less than three symbols, your card will reset and you will lose any points that you have earned so far.
