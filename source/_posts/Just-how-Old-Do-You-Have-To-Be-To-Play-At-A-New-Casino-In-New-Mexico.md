#  Just how Old Do You Have To Be To Play At A New Casino In New Mexico?

Online casinos have been around for quite a while and there are now new casino sites that are being launched every day. So, what is the legal age to gamble at a new casino in NM?

The Gambling Age in New Mexico
The gambling age in New Mexico is currently 18. This means that anyone over the age of 18 can gamble at any of the licensed casinos in the state. Anyone under the age of 18 is not allowed to gamble at any casino, online or offline.

What If I'm Not From New Mexico?
If you're not from New Mexico and you're visiting the state, you must be over 21 to gamble at a casino. This is also the case if you're from another state but happen to be visiting New Mexico on holiday.

Are There Any Exceptions To The Gambling Age In New Mexico?

#  Minimum Age Requirement Imposed For New Casino In New Mexico

On the 1st of January, a minimum age requirement was put into place for new casino licenses in the state of New Mexico. The new law will require that all applicants for a license must be at least 21 years old.

The reasoning behind this new law is twofold. First, it is intended to protect minors from being exposed to gambling at an early age. Second, it is hoped that this measure will help to deter crime and associated problems such as money laundering.

Previous rules in New Mexico allowed for casino licenses to be issued to anyone over 18 years of age. This led to a number of undesirable outcomes, including young people being able to gamble illegally and criminal elements using casinos as a cover for illegal activities.

Opponents of the new rule claim that it will have a negative impact on the economy, as it will dissuade potential investors from setting up businesses in New Mexico. However, many lawmakers feel that the benefits of this measure outweigh any potential drawbacks.

The new rule comes into effect as part of sweeping changes to gambling laws in New Mexico. These changes were brought about by the passage of Senate Bill 328 earlier this year.
