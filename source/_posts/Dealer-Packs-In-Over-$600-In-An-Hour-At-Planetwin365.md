#  Dealer Packs In Over $600 In An Hour At Planetwin365

The poker room at PlanetWin365 is always a hot spot for cash games. On Wednesday night, one player managed to take advantage of the loose action and win big.

The game was $1/$2 NLHE, and the player started by buying in for $200. Within an hour, the player had added another $400 to their stack, courtesy of some unlucky opponents. The final hand of the evening saw the player make a straight on the river to beat their opponent’s two pair. This pot put an additional $600 in the player’s pocket, taking their total winnings for the evening to over $1000.

Planetwin365 is one of the leading online poker rooms for European players. The site offers a wide range of cash games and tournaments, as well as soft competition and great bonuses.

#  Poker Dealer Nets Nearly $1,000 An Hour

Working as a poker dealer is a good way to make money. Dealers can make nearly $1,000 an hour, depending on the casino.

Some dealers may also receive benefits, such as health insurance and 401k plans. In addition, dealers can work as many hours as they want.

The job of a poker dealer is to deal cards and oversee the game. They must be able to keep track of the game and ensure that all players are following the rules.

Dealers must also be able to handle money and make change. They may also have to supervise pit bosses and security personnel.

Dealers must be able to work in a high-pressure environment. They must also be able to stay calm under pressure.

 Training for a poker dealer position varies depending on the casino. Some casinos require dealers to have a degree in gambling studies or a related field. Other casinos may only require a high school diploma or GED.

dealers must be at least 21 years old in order to work in most casinos.

#  How Several Hands Do Dealers Make In An Hour?

On an average, dealers make around $20-$25 per hour. However, this number can vary depending on the casino, the game being played and the dealer's skills.

One of the reasons for the variation is that dealers are typically classified into one of three categories: low, medium or high rollers. Low rollers generally make about $15 per hour, while high rollers can make up to $40 or more.

Different casino games also pay out differently. Slot machines may only pay out a few cents per pull, while blackjack and poker can pay out hundreds of dollars per hour. This means that a dealer who is skilled at playing blackjack or poker can make more money than one who specializes in slot machines.

In general though, most dealers make between $15 and $30 per hour. This is a decent wage considering that dealers do not need any special training or education. They simply learn how to play the games they will be dealing from other employees or online guides.

#  Dealers Net More Than $1,200 In An Hour

The record-breaking sale of a Tesla Model S electric car at auction last month netted its new owner more than $1,200 per hour of ownership. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but it’s hardly a windfall in the world of luxury cars.

In fact, high-end dealerships typically earn more than $1,200 per hour from sales of their most expensive models. A recent study by industry research firm ALG found that dealers make an average of $1,278 profit on every hour they spend selling a car worth more than $80,000.

That profit comes from a number of sources. The biggest is the markup on the car itself, which can be as much as 50 percent above the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. Dealers also make money on financing and insurance products they sell to buyers, and they often earn commissions from the manufacturers for each car they sell.

The markup on high-end cars varies depending on the market. In North America and Europe, dealers typically charge more for luxury models than they do in Asia or South America. But regardless of where they’re sold, dealers always make more on expensive cars than they do on less costly models.

ALG’s study found that dealers make an average profit of just $66 on every hour they spend selling a car worth less than $30,000. That number climbs to $848 per hour for cars in the $50,000 to $80,000 range, and peaks at $1,278 for vehicles costing more than $80,000.

Some people may find those numbers shocking or offensive, but there’s no denying that high-end dealers are providing a valuable service—one that commands a premium price tag.
