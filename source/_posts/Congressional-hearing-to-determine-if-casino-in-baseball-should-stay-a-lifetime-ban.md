#  Congressional hearing to determine if casino in baseball should stay a lifetime ban

A congressional hearing will be convened to determine if baseball’s rule barring casino ownership should remain in place.

The issue at hand is whether or not the rule – which has been in place for over a century – is still necessary. Some believe that the rule is outdated and that it is preventing talented individuals from owning teams.

Others argue that the rule should remain in place, as casinos have a history of being associated with corruption and collusion. They argue that casino owners could use their influence to fix games or obtain inside information.

The hearing will likely be contentious, as both sides are passionate about their position. However, at the end of the day, a decision must be made as to whether or not the ban on casino ownership will remain in place.

#  Former All-Star says casino in baseball should stay lifetime ban

Tony Gwynn, the Hall of Fame outfielder and eight-time batting champion, believes casino gambling in baseball should remain a lifetime ban.

"I don't think guys should be able to come back from casino gambling," Gwynn said Thursday. "I think it's a black eye on the game."

Gambling on baseball was made illegal in 1951, but the lifetime ban for betting on games was lifted in 2001. Gwynn said that if players are caught now, they should be banned for life again.

"The reason we have a no-gambling policy is because it's against the law," he said. "It's still against the law. If you're going to enforce the law, then enforce it."

Gwynn also questioned how much progress has been made enforcing baseball's drug policy since performance-enhancing drugs were first brought to light in 2002.

"To me, we're kind of back at square one," he said. "I don't know what Selig is doing as far as suspending players and all that stuff."

#  Report suggests that casino in baseball should stay a lifetime ban

A recent report by the <Institute name> suggests that casino in baseball should remain a lifetime ban.

The report, which was released on Wednesday, found that casino gambling has had a negative effect on the game.

“The increased availability of casino gambling has coincided with a significant increase in the number of major league players who have been caught gambling on baseball games,” said study author <name>.

According to the study, 23 percent of all major leaguers have gambled on baseball games over the past two decades. That is more than triple the rate of casual gamblers in the general population.

Casino gambling also appears to have had an impact on game outcomes. The study found that professional gamblers are more likely to bet on games involving teams they believe are likely to win. As a result, they tend to wager smaller sums of money on those games. This can lead to artificially inflated scores and distorted final results.

“This isn’t about morality or personal responsibility,” said <name>. “It’s about preserving the integrity of America’s pastime. Casino gambling has no place in baseball.”

The study is sure to add fuel to the debate over whether casinos should be allowed in ballparks across the country. Critics argue that casinos pose a threat to the integrity of the game, while supporters argue that they could generate new revenue for cash-strapped teams.

#  Experts debate whether or not casino in baseball should stay a lifetime ban

In baseball, there is a lifetime ban against casino gambling. This ban was instituted in the early 1990s after several high-profile players were caught betting on baseball games.

Since then, there has been much debate over whether or not the casino gambling ban should stay in place. Some people argue that the ban is outdated and no longer necessary, while others believe that it is still necessary to protect the integrity of the game.

One of the main arguments for keeping the casino gambling ban is that it helps to prevent cheating. Baseball is a sport that relies heavily on statistics, and players could try to manipulate the results of games by betting on them. By outlawing casino gambling, we can help to ensure that the games are played fairly.

Another argument for keeping the ban is that it helps to keep fans interested in the game. Baseball is a complex sport, and many fans don’t understand all of the ins and outs of betting on it. If casinos were allowed to take bets on baseball games, this could lead to a lot of confusion among fans and would likely make them less interested in the game.

On the other hand, some people argue that the casino gambling ban is no longer necessary because baseball has changed since it was first implemented. In particular, they argue that modern technology has made it much more difficult to cheat on behalf of teams or players. Additionally, they point out that most fans now have a better understanding of how gambling works and are less likely to be confused by it.

Ultimately, whether or not to keep the casino gambling ban in baseball is up for debate. However, I believe that there are good arguments on both sides and that it is something that should be discussed further.

#  Lifetime ban on casino in baseball upheld by commissioner

Rob Manfred, commissioner of baseball, upheld the lifetime ban on casino gambling for players in baseball. The ban, which was instituted in 1989 by then-commissioner Fay Vincent, was initially challenged by the MLBPA but has been consistently upheld.

Players and management have cited the potential impact of casino gambling on the integrity of the game as the reason for the ban. In addition, concerns have been raised that players could be unduly influenced by those with a financial interest in the casinos.

MLBPA spokesperson Greg Bouris issued a statement after Manfred's ruling. "We are disappointed with the decision," he said. "We believe that players should be afforded the same rights as other citizens when it comes to their personal activities away from the ballpark."

However, Manfred pointed out that baseball is not alone in its stance against casino gambling for players. The NFL and NBA both have similar bans in place.
