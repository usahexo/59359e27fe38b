#  IRS Clarifies What is Considered Gambling When Filing Taxes 

In a recent blog post, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) clarified when gambling income is considered taxable. 

According to the IRS, “Gambling income includes, but is not limited to, winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse and dog races, and casinos. It also includes cash and the fair market value of prizes such as cars and trips.” However, there are some exceptions. For example, “Gambling losses are not deductible.” 

In order to report gambling income on your tax return, you will need to keep track of all of your winnings and losses throughout the year. You can do this by recording your bets and track your winnings and losses in a diary or ledger. Alternatively, you can use a gambling tracking software or app. 

If you have any questions about what is considered gambling income and how it should be reported on your tax return, please contact a tax professional.

#  What happens if you report gambling winnings on your taxes? 

If you're lucky enough to have won some money from gambling, you may be wondering if you need to report those winnings on your taxes. The answer is: it depends.

In most cases, gambling winnings are taxable income. This means that you'll need to report the amount of your winnings as income on your tax return and pay taxes on it. However, there are a few exceptions.

For example, if you won a small prize from a lottery or raffle, the winnings are typically not taxable. And if you gamble purely for entertainment purposes and don't make a profit, your gambling winnings won't be taxed either.

But in most other cases, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. This includes winning money from betting on sports, playing casino games, or poker tournaments.

If you do have to pay taxes on your gambling winnings, the amount will depend on how much you won. For tax year 2018, the IRS Tax Tables specify that tax rates range from 10% to 37%. So if you won $1,000 in gambling proceeds during the year, you would owe around $100-$370 in taxes (depending on your tax bracket).

Reporting your gambling winnings is relatively simple. You'll just need to include the amount of your winnings on line 21 of Form 1040 (the “Other Income” section), and then indicate what type of gambling it was (casino games, race track betting, etc.) 

If you have any questions about whether or not you need to report your gambling winnings, be sure to consult with a tax professional.
