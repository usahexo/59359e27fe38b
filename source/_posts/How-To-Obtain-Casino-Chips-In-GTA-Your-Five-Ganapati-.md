 glitch casino chips in GTA your five Ganapati


What's up guys, ziggyduck here and in this video I'm going to show you how to glitch casino chips in your 5 Ganapati. This is a really cool little exploit that I found and it's really easy to do. So let's get started.

The first thing you're going to want to do is go into a casino and buy some chips. I'm just going to use the example of the Vinewood Casino for this tutorial. Once you have your chips, head over to the poker table and start playing. Now what you're going to want to do is wait until you have around 2,000 chips or so, then quit the game. You don't actually have to lose, you can just quit.

Now if you look in your inventory, you should see that the 2,000 chips are now worth $200,000 instead of $20,000. This is because the game glitches and gives you double the amount of chips when you quit the game. So now all you have to do is take your $200,000 and head over to the cashier and exchange them for real money. Congrats, you've just glitched casino chips in GTA 5!

There are a few things that you need to keep in mind though if you want to make this exploit work correctly. First off, it only seems to work with poker tables and not blackjack or other tables. Secondly, if another player busts out while you're still playing then the exploit will not work properly and you'll only get half of the doubled amount of chips when quitting. Finally, there have been reports of people losing their money after exchanging it at the cashier, so use this exploit at your own risk.

That's all for now guys, thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.

#  How To Get Free Casino Chips In GTA Your Five Ganapati

Casinos in Grand Theft Auto V are a great place to make some money. They’re also a great place to blow it all in short order. The games are entertaining, and the drinks are free (as long as you’re gambling). But if you don’t have any money to gamble with, don’t worry – there are ways to get casino chips for free.

The simplest way to get chips without spending any money is to take advantage of the game’s rewards system. Every time you play a game at the casino, you earn loyalty points – even if you lose. You can then exchange these loyalty points for casino chips. The amount of loyalty points you earn depends on the game you play and your level of difficulty.

Another way to get free casino chips is by taking advantage of bonus offers. Casinos often offer bonus chips for signing up or for making a deposit. These bonuses usually come with certain conditions, such as wagering requirements, so be sure to read the terms and conditions before accepting them.

One thing to keep in mind when trying to get free casino chips is that casinos don’t like giving away their valuable chips for free. So don’t expect to be able to just walk in and start cashing in on bonuses and rewards. It may take some effort on your part, but it’s worth it if you want to enjoy the games without spending any money.
