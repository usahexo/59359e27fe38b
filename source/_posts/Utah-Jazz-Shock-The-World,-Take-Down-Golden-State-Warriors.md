#  Utah Jazz Shock The World, Take Down Golden State Warriors

It was a matchup of the two best teams in the NBA, and fans were expecting a great game. However, no one could have predicted what would happen next.

The Utah Jazz came out hot, taking an early lead and never looking back. They dominated the Golden State Warriors on both ends of the court, winning by a final score of 118-108.

This was a huge upset for the Warriors, who were heavily favored to win. The Jazz simply played better basketball on this night, and deserve all the credit for their impressive victory.

This is just the latest in a string of disappointing losses for Golden State, who are now struggling to keep their grip on first place in the Western Conference. The Warriors will need to get back on track quickly if they hope to make another run at the championship this year.

James Harden had a triple-double for Houston with 36 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, but it wasn't enough to overcome Utah's furious comeback. Chris Paul also reached double figures with 18 points for the Rockets.

#  Utah Jazz Survive Late scare From Denver Nuggets

Denver was led by Nikola Jokic, who had 29 points and 14 rebounds. Jamal Murray chipped in with 25 points off the bench.

Gobert then hit one of two free throws to give Utah a 97-95 lead. Denver had one final chance to win or tie the game, but Murray's desperation three-pointer at the buzzer fell short.

"That was a heck of a game," Jazz coach Quin Snyder said after the game. "It came down to the last shot."

Mitchell was impressed by Denver's young nucleus of Jokic, Murray and Gary Harris. "They are going to be good for a long time," Mitchell said. "They are really talented."
