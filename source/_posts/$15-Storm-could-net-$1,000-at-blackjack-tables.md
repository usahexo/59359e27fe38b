## $15 Storm

A powerful storm system that moved across the central United States over the weekend could result in some windfall earnings at blackjack tables, with experts predicting as much as a $1,000 payout for gamblers wagering just $15.

The storm brought high winds and blizzard conditions to states from Texas to Missouri, resulting in major travel disruptions and power outages. In some cases, the winds were so strong that they knocked down large trees and power lines.

For casino-goers looking for a chance to take advantage of the bad weather, blackjack is likely the best bet. With a house edge of less than 1 percent, players have a good chance of walking away from the table with a profit, even after accounting for losses suffered during unlucky hands.

In order to capitalize on the storm, however, players will need to act quickly. Many casinos are likely to close their doors early this week in anticipation of more bad weather. So those looking to make some extra cash should head to the tables today or tomorrow while the storm’s impact is still being felt.
